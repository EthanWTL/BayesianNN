## Introduction:
Welcome,

This is a repo associate with the ongoing paper [A Survey about Bayesian Inference Power in Math and Machine Learning Perspectives](Bayesian_Inference_first_draft.pdf)

Besides explaining topics included in the paper, this repo will focus on walking through the implementation of [MCMC]() and [Variational Inference]() in the Linear Regression field.
